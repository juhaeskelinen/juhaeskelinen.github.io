I keep six honest serving-men<br />
(They taught me all I knew);<br />
Their names are <strong>What</strong> and <strong>Why</strong> and <strong>When</strong><br />
And <strong>How</strong> and <strong>Where</strong> and <strong>Who</strong>.<br />
I send them over land and sea,<br />
I send them east and west;<br />
But after they have worked for me,<br />
I give them all a rest.<br />
<br />
I let them rest from nine till five,<br />
For I am busy then,<br />
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br />
For they are hungry men.<br />
But different folk have different views; <br />
I know a person small-<br />
She keeps ten million serving-men,<br />
Who get no rest at all!<br />
<br />
She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,<br />
From the second she opens her eyes-<br />
One million Hows, two million Wheres,<br />
And seven million Whys!<br />
<br />
